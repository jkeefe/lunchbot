# lunchbot for Slack
We can never decide where to eat for lunch, so this bot will tell us what to do. Or at least make a suggestion. 

This bot, built for [Slack](https://slack.com/), posts its decision into a team Slack channel.

##Dependencies

Well, the big thing this requires is [Slack](https://slack.com/), which is a team communications tool we use.

This is a program written in JavaScript for [Node](http://nodejs.org/), and it uses the the Request node module.

	npm install request
